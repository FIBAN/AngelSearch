# Auth0 Code

This folder contains the source code of rules which are scripts that are
run for each user when they log in. At the time of writing there is no
automated CI/CD set up for these scripts so it's best to check the actual
version of the scripts from the Auth0 admin panel.

The `rules` directory contains the rule code and the files are numbered
in the order that they are processed. For more information on how the
rules work check [Auth0 Documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
